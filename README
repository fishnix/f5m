Barebones, quick and dirty F5 configuration parser.
- Work in progress
- May not parse everything (we don't use every feature and so I didn't include every feature)
- Includes a "migrated" flag since the purpose was to help us
  find deps and keep track of what we've moved to our new pair of LTMs

TODO:
 - parse profiles
 - update virtuals view to include jquery links for rules + profiles
 - add contact information model and link to virtuals
 - Dependency tracking on virtual for "ready to migrate"
 - Diff parsing so data can be updated with newer bigip.conf's
