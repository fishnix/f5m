Barebones, quick and dirty F5 configuration parser.
- Work in progress
- May not parse everything (we don't use every feature and so I didn't include every feature)
- Will include a "migrated" flag since the purpose was to help us
  find deps and keep track of what we've moved to our new pair of LTMs
