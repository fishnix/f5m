Barebones, quick and dirty F5 configuration parser.
- Work in progress
- May not parse everything (we don't use every feature and so I didn't include every feature)
- Includes a "migrated" flag since the purpose was to help us
  find deps and keep track of what we've moved to our new pair of LTMs

TODO:
 - Dependency tracking on virtual for "ready to migrate"
 - Diff parsing so data can be updated with newer bigip.conf's
 - httpclasses are not shown as links in virtual view

Known Bugs:
 - profiles are parsed wrong, type missing in model
 - modal popup doesn't work for members/nodes in the pool view
 - Node modal on pools index is broken
